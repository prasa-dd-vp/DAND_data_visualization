# Data Visualization

Here, I have made visualizations on a dataset named “Indian Startup Funding” which contains funding details of the startups in India between January 2015 and August 2017. The dataset has 2373 rows and 10 columns. The visualization will explain how ‘AmountInUSD’ varies with the other factors with respect to time.
